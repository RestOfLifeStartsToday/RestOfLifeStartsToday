**Project description**

The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data
Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not
sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that
evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:

-   The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are
    triggered when a person is buying alcohol

-   Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person
    from a photo

-   The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying
    people\'s age

To start working on the task, you\'ll have a set of photographs of
people with their ages indicated.

**Project Instructions**

1.  Pass a quiz to verify your understanding of the project statement.

2.  Perform exploratory data analysis to get an overall impression of
    the dataset.

3.  Train and evaluate the model (it needs to be done on the GPU
    platform).

4.  Combine your code, output and findings (from the previous points) in
    the final Jupyter notebook.

5.  Make conclusions of the model evaluation, add them to the notebook.

6.  Project reviewers will review your final notebook.


**Hint**

Perform the exploratory data analysis:

-   Look at the dataset size.

-   Explore the age distribution in the dataset.

-   Print 10-15 photos for different ages on the screen to get an
    overall impression of the dataset.

Paths to the files for analysis:

-   \'/datasets/faces/labels.csv\'

-   \'/datasets/faces/final_files/\'

Provide findings on how the specifics of the dataset you discover may
affect how the model is trained.

Save the notebook under a meaningful name.
